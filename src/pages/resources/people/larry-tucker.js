        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry was born in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, to Mary Katherine and Charles
          Wilson Tucker, in 1950. His younger sister, Phyllis, was born two
          years later. They grew up on the typical rural farmstead…unpainted
          house, water well, and a “one-holer” outhouse. Even though times were
          tough, the family was close, and there was always plenty to eat.The
          on-site smokehouse always had ham and bacon curing inside, and fresh
          vegetables from the garden were canned for use year-round. The family
          milk cow provided milk and butter, chickens laid eggs, and the herd of
          beef cattle raised on the farm filled the freezer for the family’s
          use.

        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry learned from an early age that everyone pitched in on a family
          farm. He learned to drive at about the age of eight on a Farmall Super
          A tractor. His dad put him on the tractor, gave him some basics, and
          let him go. Larry promptly ran it into a shallow ditch on the side of
          the road. In true teaching fashion, his dad got the tractor out of the
          ditch and headed toward home. After a typical “This won’t happen
          again, will it?”, Larry was instructed to drive the tractor home,
          although in its lowest gear and at an idle! Within a few years, it was
          not uncommon to look out from the family farmhouse at the end of the
          workday and see Larry, his dad, and his grandfather, all on their own
          tractors, making their way back from the fields. Even after he married
          and moved from home, he often would come back in the summer and help
          his dad get the crop in.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Even though Larry loved life on the farm, it was hard and dirty work.
          His parents stressed the importance of an education, especially since
          neither of them completed high school. Larry and Phyllis both went on
          to earn Masters degrees and Larry did some work toward his Doctorate
          before his children entered college. Larry and his sister both pursued
          careers in public Education.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          It was the late elementary years that proved to be a pivotal point in
          Larry’s life. The high school band director, Bill Clark, came to the
          fifth-grade classrooms and invited all who were interested to come to
          a meeting in the school cafeteria to learn about joining the band.
          Larry was intrigued and couldn’t wait to play trumpet in the band.
          Unfortunately, his family could not afford a trumpet. Dr. Clark was
          not one to lose a student and started Larry on a King bell-front,
          three-valve baritone horn playing tuba music from the “Easy Steps to
          the Band” method book. Of course, when he got to Junior High band, the
          notation was quite different. That’s when Dr. Clark told Larry it was
          time to graduate from the “baby tuba.” Thus began the life of a new
          tuba player for the Arkadelphia band program!
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          The Arkadelphia High School years were a great time for Larry. He
          loved the band and the wonderful sounds surrounding him each day in
          rehearsals. Dr. Clark was an excellent role model and motivator. Larry
          and Dr. Clark would on occasion go bird hunting together and developed
          a friendship that has lasted over forty years. Also during that time,
          it was not uncommon for Dr. Francis McBeth to bring a new manuscript
          to the AHS band hall for the band to read. That contact spawned a
          friendship with Dr. McBeth that has led to numerous guest conducting
          appearances and a commission with Larry’s bands over the years. Also
          an important event during that time…Larry met his high school
          sweetheart, Marion, who was eager to accept a ride in Larry’s 1965 red
          Mustang! After four years of dating, they married and recently
          celebrated their thirty-ninth wedding anniversary. Their son, Jason,
          and daughter-in-law, Cyndi, are both successful band directors and
          daughter, Jennifer Penny, is a middle school gifted education teacher.
          Son-in-law, Mike Penny, is a graphic designer. Larry and Marion have
          two granddaughters, Madison and Meredith, who are the apple of
          “Papaw’s” eye!
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry was offered a full-scholarship to Henderson State University,
          where he studied under Wendell Evanson, a former Revelli student. Don
          Kramer, from the Joliet, IL, band program, and Dr. Dwayne Sagen, now
          at Vanderbilt University, were all instrumental in developing Larry’s
          skills and philosophy and have been life-long friends and mentors.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry was a mid-term graduate and there were two jobs open in the
          state at the winter break. He accepted the Lonoke, AR, high school
          position and was responsible for all band instruction for grades 6-12.
          Larry learned two valuable lessons during his tenure at Lonoke. First,
          never chart a full-band, unison rear march. Fortunately, the band got
          off the field without any injuries! And second, he learned how to
          promote his program. The band’s uniforms were almost twenty years old,
          faded, and frayed. To promote new uniforms for the band, he put a
          sample on a mannequin in the local men’s store and asked for the
          community to support the effort to raise funds. After those efforts
          fell short, Larry met with the school board and remembers the
          superintendent pushing away from the table when the item came up for
          discussion. When it became obvious the board was going to support the
          expenditure, the superintendent moved back to the table and offered
          his support! At the end of the year, Larry had an opportunity to move
          back into his home region and chose to do so.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry was named Director of Bands at Ashdown, AR, high school in 1974.
          The high school band at that time was class AA, contained grades 8-12,
          and played off the grade two list. By the time he left seven years
          later, the band was AAA, contained grades 10-12, and played off the
          grade four list, consistently making first division ratings. Those
          were great years and Larry remembers many wonderful students. It was
          during this time that he hired Travis Smith as Junior High director,
          which began a more than thirty year friendship. Larry was very active
          in the First United Methodist Church, leading the chancel choir and
          the United Methodist Youth Fellowship. In 1981, the opportunity to
          move to Texas presented itself when Larry was offered the position of
          Director of Bands at Plano East Senior High. He remembers the
          interview well because not only did he interview with the committee in
          Plano, but the committee also came to Arkansas to conduct interviews
          on site. After meeting with Larry’s principal, superintendent, and
          having homemade snacks served by Marion at the Tucker home, the
          committee made the decision to offer the position to Larry. He often
          says it was Marion’s cooking that sealed the job offer at Plano East!
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Plano East was designed for 2200 students but opened with a charter
          class of about 600. Larry’s first rehearsal with his new AAAAA band
          had eighteen members! Because the fine arts building had not been
          completed, the band met in a classroom in the business education
          department. As it turned out, this was not a bad move since he and his
          students became endeared to the rest of the building for their daily
          live entertainment. When the fine arts building was completed in
          November, the band made the move to the new facility. By the end of
          the year, he had convinced several former members to rejoin the band
          and membership was up to twenty-five. Holst, Vaughan Williams, and
          military band music became staples in the band’s repertoire that first
          year! While the band did not enter UIL that year, they did compete in
          the solo-ensemble competition as a medium ensemble performing The
          Marriage of Figaro.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry remembers several great moments during the years at Plano East.
          First, when the Plano East Panthers first played cross-town rival, the
          Plano Senior High Wildcats, he made a last-minute change in the
          halftime show. The band had closed its show at UIL on Tuesday with The
          Battle Hymn of the Republic. Larry changed the routes for the flag
          corps and, on Friday night, a United States flag, reaching from 35 to
          35 yard lines, was unfurled behind the band. The capacity crowd of
          more that 15,000 immediately responded with a resounding standing
          ovation and firmly established the fact that there was a “New Cat in
          Town, and it was Hungry!” Later that year, after its first UIL
          sweepstakes awards, the fifty-four members of the band won the Gateway
          Music Festival in St. Louis. It was a great moment for the members,
          and they hoisted Larry on their shoulders and carried him off the
          stage at the awards ceremony. Over the next several years, the Plano
          East bands went on to make sweepstakes each year, won national
          invitational contests, and performed at several conventions, including
          the College Band Directors National Association and National Band
          Association, the Four States Bandmasters Association, and the ArkLaTex
          Conductors conference. At one national contest in Orlando, the band
          arrived at the contest site, at 7:00am, an hour early, only to find no
          equipment on the stage. He and his students moved equipment from the
          band hall and began their warm-up late. The judges came in at the
          assigned time and told him it was time to begin. Larry explained to
          the judges the situation and asked them to go down the hall and get
          another cup of coffee. He would send for them when the band was ready.
          The band went on to win Best in Concert awards for the contest! Larry
          was offered the opportunity to move to the Director of Performing Arts
          position at the end of 1989 and was not ready to leave the classroom.
          Recognizing the fact it might be years before a similar opportunity
          presented itself again, Larry accepted and made the move to
          administration.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry spent eighteen years in fine arts administration. During that
          time the directors on the staff and their organizations had numerous
          appearances at The Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic, TMEA as Honor
          groups, the Music Educators National Conference, the Lincoln Center,
          and the Kennedy Center. Larry’s stated goal as an administrator was to
          “hire the best, give them what they need to succeed, and then get out
          of their way!” His office door was always open, unless the visitor
          closed it on his or her way in. If he had a serious concern about the
          performance of a staff member, he went to their campus. He strongly
          believed in the old adage “compliment in public, criticize in
          private.” Two of his favorite expressions were, “when an old dog
          barks, pay attention” and “you can’t push a rope, you’ve got to lead
          it where you want it to go.”
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry was named Teacher of the Year for Plano East in 1989 and went on
          to also receive the Ross Perot Excellence in Teaching Award that year.
          He was named Texas Music Administrators Conference Music Administrator
          of the Year in 2006. In 2007, he was runner-up for the Arts in
          Education award for the City of Plano, coming in second to the Plano
          ISD! He has served as president of the Four States Bandmasters
          Association, state chairman of the National Band Association,
          president of Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Mu, president of the Texas
          Music Administrators Conference, and president of the Plano West
          Rotary Club. He served four years on the Cultural Affairs Commission,
          two as chairman, for the City of Plano. He was a Paul Harris Fellow
          and recognized by the Plano West Rotary Club as Rotarian of the Year
          in 2004 and 2006, as well as by the Rotary Foundation for his
          contributions to the Wheelchairs for Kids efforts for South Africa.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          Larry held, memberships in the American School Band Directors
          Association, Phi Mu Alpha, MENC, TMEA, TBA, NBA, FSBA, TMAA, TMAC, and
          Phi Beta Mu. He and Marion have been members of the First United
          Methodist Church in Plano since 1981.
        </FuturaParagraph>
        <FuturaParagraph>
          He retired in 2007 after thirty-five years in education and passed
          away on August 15, 2013.
