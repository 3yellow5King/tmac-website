          He received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees from
          Baylor, in 1949 and 1950. He earned a Bachelor of Sacred Music degree
          from Southwestern Theological Seminary in 1951, and a Master of
          Science degree from Baylor in 1965. After 15 years as choral director
          at Waco High School, he became Director of Music Education for the
          Waco Independent School District in 1964 and then Director of Fine
          Arts for WISD. He retired from the school system in 1991. During his
          tenure there he served often as adjudicator for University
          Interscholastic League Choral and Sight Reading Contests, as well as
          Solo and Ensemble Contests statewide, and he was a frequent clinician
          for school and church choral workshops. He also served as the Director
          of the Methodist Home Title I program for a number of years, and the
          Director of the WISD Elementary Gifted and Talented Program. Mr.
          Howard was the coordinator of the Childrenâ€™s Symphony programs, a
          collaboration of the Baylor Symphony and many area school districts,
          from 1964 to 1992. For 51 years, he also directed church choirs,
          serving successively as Minister of Music at Emmanuel Baptist Church,
          Columbus Avenue Baptist Church, Bellmead First Baptist Church, and
          Park Lake Drive Baptist Church. After retiring, he attended First
          Baptist Church.

          Mr. Howard was active in state and national professional
          organizations, holding offices including National Elementary Committee
          Chairman for the American Choral Directors Association, Vice President
          of the Texas Choral Directors Association, and Vice President of the
          Texas Music Educators Association. He served on the Texas State
          Textbook Committee. Locally, Mr. Howard was a member of the board of

          served on the boards of the WISD Foundation, the Greater Waco Council
          for the Arts, and the Central Texas Council for Music Education. In
          retirement, he was active in the Waco Welcome Corps, the Coalition for
          Music Education, and the Gideons International. In 1988, Baylor
          University School of Music awarded him special recognition for
          distinguished service in music education. In 2001, a group of former
          high school students and friends established a scholarship at Baylor
          in his honor, and in 2008, he was honored with the Distinguished
          Retired Faculty Award by the WISD Education Foundation.
